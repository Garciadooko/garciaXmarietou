                  <h2>The favelas</h2>
        
                    <p>Rio de Janeiro's favelas are informal settlements characterized by densely populated, often hillside communities, known for their vibrant culture and unique challenges. These neighborhoods, such as Rocinha and Complexo do Alemão, house a significant portion of the city's population. The architecture is characterized by makeshift homes, often stacked closely together, offering panoramic views of the city below. Favelas are renowned for their resilient spirit, creative street art, and a strong sense of community. However, they also face socio-economic issues, including poverty, limited access to public services, and occasional violence. Efforts have been made to improve conditions, with community-driven initiatives and government interventions working towards creating positive change within these vibrant, complex urban landscapes.</p>
